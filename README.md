# ICS4U CPT (Edit this)

* In my ICS4U1 CPT, data about the cumulative amount of objects that have been launched into space is being projected using two different charts. The charts being used are a drilldown pie chart and a bar chart. A drilldown pie chart is a pie chart where if you click on a point of data in the chart, it will open a separate pie chart containing information within the section clicked on. For example, you can click on the continent Europe, and then it will show you the data relating to Europe. You can then click on France and it will show all data relating to France such as the how many items they sent to space each year. There is also a switch button above the graph that will allow you to switch between which of the two graphs are being shown.
